			<h3>Rules:</h3>
			<li>The goal of the game is to capture the enemy king</li>
			<li>Units can move in any direction as many times as their movement value.</li>
			<li>Units can only capture by moving in a straight line</li>
			<li>To capture an enemy, it must be "engaged" by at least as many units as it's armor value.</li>
			<li>Enemies with 0 armor don't need to be engaged to be captured</li>
			<li>Your units can engage enemies in a straight, unblocked line, up to the unit's engage range</li>
			<li>Mountains block movement and engage; you can't engage someone across mountains, even if your engage is greater than 1</li>
			<li>If a unit is on water, it can't engage anything</li>

			<br />
