A (hideous) JS/HTML5 interactive playable variant of George R.R. Martin's imagined medieval board game, Cyvasse


The UI is really obnoxious right now, especially since the tiles used to make up the game board are two-sided, and that's really hard to express on a 2D surface. That in mind, to get started playing a local two-player game, just click "Play!"
